Project demonstrates:
* **Code Coverage** - with [JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)
* **Mutation Coverage** - with [Pitest](https://pitest.org/)

### Coverage adjustments

*lombok.config* settings - ignores autogenerated lines - we don't test Lombok (we believe it works!):
```
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
```
